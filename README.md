This repo is used to house our organisation-wide health files, which can include `CONTRIBUTING`, `SUPPORT`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`(S), or `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE`(S). If another organisation repo doesn't include one of these files, it will fallback to the one found in this repo.

See [here](https://github.blog/changelog/2019-02-21-organization-wide-community-health-files/) for more info.
